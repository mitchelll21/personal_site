            <h1>Digital Culture and Information Minor Portfolio</h1>
            <h2>As part of the minor requirements, we put together a portfolio of our projects and what we learned. Below you will find four projects I felt were worthy of hihglighting with a reflection and link to the site. The projects are in reverse chronological order.</h2>
            <h3><a href='http://mitchelll21.wludci.info/current/index2.html'>The Use of Social Media in Collegiate Athletic Recruitment</a></h3>
            <h4>DCI Capstone - Winter 2021</h4>
            <p>This project was an opportunity for me to further explore my interest in sports communications on a closer level. I chose to look into how social media is used by college coaches and prospective student athletes when going through the recruitment process. This began as an independent study in fall 2020 with a series of interviews with Washington and Lee University varsity coaches and student athletes. I used the interviews to get more of a qualitative look at the usage of social media. The following semester I sent a survey out to the Washington and Lee athletic community to collect data on the differences between how coaches and students use social media across sports. I chose to house my research on a website I built from HTML and CSS. I liked the extra element to the project and the ability to say I built my own digital portfolio. I made my website very simple and easy to navigate as you click through my research pages so users of any age/computer experience has access to the material. I also made a podcast discussing the qualitative research section as a way for users who are vision impaired had access to material as well. This project was geared more towards a professional audience as it could be a resource for collegiate coaches or athletes, as well as a potential academic article. </p>
            <p>I felt this project was a great way to utilize a multitude of skills learned throughout the minor process. I used HTML and CSS that I first learned in DCI 110, analysis and data visualization from DCI 102, and general story telling through the web that I learned from every class. I think the final product is one that looks clean and simple while containing a wealth of information. I am really proud of every part of this final project and everything I learned in the process. </p>
            <p>This year long project was not always easy but it was really rewarding. I felt myself really grow in my communication skills from the interviews and curating the analysis of data. All the skills learned and displayed though this project are directly applicable to my future professional career.</p>

            <h3><a href='https://mitchelll21.wludci.info/dci102/unit1assignments/research-question/'>Mental Health Discussion in the Ring Tum Phi</a></h3>
            <h4>DCI 102: Data in the Humanities – Fall 2019</h4>
            <p>In this project I used archived Ring Tum Phi articles to examine how mental health topics are discussed and what language is used when discussing them. I used Voyant to generate visualizations that show how frequency of mental health topics have grown over time and how different terminology is prevalent at different times. To showcase this project, I made a WordPress site that is clean and simple. The research question, findings, and documentation are easily accessible for anyone to go through. I also have links to the Voyant visualizations that make them interactive for a more immersive experience. As a cognitive and behavioral science major, I found my audience for this project to be both professional and academic as the topic is relevant in any field but also narrowed in on mental health conversation on a college campus.</p>
            <p>This project was a great stepping-stone in learning how to use more qualitative data in research. The visualizations are clear and a fun way to see the connections I was trying to make while also showing skills on multiple platforms. The website is a great place to house the information because of how it encases all of my data in the humanities projects which show off a specific set of analytical skills that may get lost in comparison to more technical projects.</p>
            <p>This project in particular was big in shaping the rest of my DCI experience. Not only did this show me how I can combine my CBSC interests with DCI, but I learned how to effectively comb through data to find what I need and show important connections for a larger audience. A big skill I learned here was how to effectively use Regular Expressions when going through the Ring Tum Phi articles. Having the opportunity to practice that skill was very valuable as I was able to continue using RegEx in future projects and I would not have had the confidence to do so if I did not use them here. Overall, I love this project because of how it so perfectly married my interests and was enjoyable throughout.</p>

            <h3><a href = 'https://dci110w19.github.io/project-madrid/'>Welcome to VisitMadrid.com </a></h3>
            <h4>DCI 110: Programming for Non-Programmers - Winter 2019</h4>
            <p>This project was my first collaboration with other students on a website. We were tasked with making a website for a foreign city that showcased AirBNB availability in specific neighborhoods. I really enjoyed this project because of the collaborative nature and the ability to share ideas. Our final product is one that is vibrant with clear goals and navigation. I feel a bit of all of our personalities came through in the project and I am very proud of what we produced. The user can personalize their experience using the different search options which I find special to this project. I also believe this is a good project to showcase professional application of these skills as this is a site that can be replicated for many business purposes.</p>
            <p>This was not an easy project as we were learning how to build websites then embed different elements to make them interactive. My mind is still blown that we were able to accomplish these elements with only one semester of instruction, but I think we did so very well. There is a lot of information on this website, but I find it easy to digest and apply. The site is interesting and clean and the information is still relevant two years later.</p>
            <p>Collaboration is not easy but we did it well with this project. I had a lot of fun exploring Madrid virtually and conceptualizing the website. The skills learned for embedding material is what elevates projects to the next level, so I am grateful to have those in my toolbox from this project. </p>

            <h3><a href = 'https://dci110w19.github.io/insiders-mitchelll21/'>Insider's Guide to Roanoke, Virginia</a></h3>
            <h4>DCI 110: Programming for Non-Programmers - Winter 2019</h4>
            <p>This was my first website ever. The assignment was to create a website that provided information on our hometown that was not available on the regular city website. This allowed us to personalize the content to what we thought was important to share with users. The layout is clean (colorful, but clean) and contains a lot of information. The interactive map of dining locations was one of the most difficult parts of the assignment, but I believe it turned out well. I think it is easy to use being it is only one page (the other pages of the assignment have been lost somewhere in the deep web). I do not think this is a website I would present to an employer as it is very basic and quite literally where it all began. I have grown a lot from this first site so it serves as a good reminder of where I started on this academic adventure and keeps me humble.</p>
            <p>The project itself is quality work with a lot of information. The links are usable, as is the map, making it a solid site. Learning to embed the map was not easy but a useful skill for future sites that will come in handy. The design choices aren’t the best but I’ll blame that on my youth. Overall, I enjoyed this project and find it important in my overall DCI journey. Had I not first done this, no other projects would have evolved and I do not think I would be where I am today without it.</p>
