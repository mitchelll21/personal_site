            <h4>Brief History of Collegiate Athletics and Formation of the NCAA</h4>
                <p>Colleges have been established in the United States since before the country was independent from Britain. Sports, however, were not part of the primary purpose these institutions served. Up until the mid-nineteenth century, manual labor was the only form of physical activity the colleges supported. The men at these schools began to organize their own forms of physical contests called ‘rushes’, a precursor to football. These rushes have been described as ‘violent’ and ‘ritualistic’, often leading college administration to try and stop these contests ("College Athletics - History Of Athletics In U.s. Colleges And Universities", 2020). Soon the events became regulated and teams from different schools began traveling to other campuses in order to compete. </p>
                <p>As football became more organized by students on college campuses, the administration struggled to maintain levels of safety that would protect their students. It is said that a player from Princeton intentionally broke the collarbone of a Dartmouth player and a Union player is said to have died in a game against NYU (Weathersby, 2020). The uptick in violence was quickly leading to colleges banning football contests, which caught the attention of President Roosevelt who was a fan of college football. On October 9th, 1905, President Roosevelt met with representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton to discuss measures to squash violence and promote healthy athletic competition. Although this meeting did not bring about immediate change, it drew attention to the issue ("College Athletics - History Of Athletics In U.s. Colleges And Universities", 2020).</p>
                <p>A few short months later, on December 28th, a group containing representatives from 60 schools met to create legitimate reform. A rules committee, along with a body of trained officials, was formed under the name of The Inter-Collegiate Athletic Association. The name was changed to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1910 ("Formation of the NCAA: Un Unexpected Beginning", 2020). </p>
                <p>Despite the focus on football, the NCAA cites rowing as the sport that started in all, based on popularity in the late nineteenth-century before football was regulated. Other sports also flourished during this time, including baseball, track and field, tennis, hockey, and gymnastics. Universities began understanding the economic impact athletic programs had on their institution as alumni and other fans began monetarily supporting such programs ("Formation of the NCAA: Un Unexpected Beginning", 2020). Ticket and memorabilia sale began incentivizing schools to build facilities and grow their programs. Schools that would become known as the Ivy League lead the charge for collegiate sports, as seen by Harvard’s construction of Soldiers’ Field in 1904 and the Yale Bowl of 1914 ("College Athletics - History Of Athletics In U.s. Colleges And Universities", 2020).</p>
            <h4>NCAA Divisions</h4>
                <p>Schools began to naturally form divisions based on proximity and similarities. According to the NCAA, three different divisions were formed for ‘competitive and legislative purposes’ in 1973. The goal was to ‘align-like minded campuses’. This can be seen with the Division III Old Dominion Athletic Conference being comprised of only private, liberal arts colleges in Virginia. Division I requires institutions to have at least seven sports for men and seven for women with two team sports for each gender. Division III institutions have to have only five sports for each gender. Both divisions have minimum contest requirements that reflect the level of commitment to each athletic program. Division I schools place larger emphasis on athletics, whereas Division III schools offer a less rigorous athletic experience and more emphasis on academics. These different focuses are also reflected in their abilities to offer financial aid to student athletes. Division I can give a student full financial aid on the basis of athletic ability, while Division III must not consider athletic ability when rewarding aid ("Divisional Differences and the History of Multidivision Classification", 2020). There are 350 Division I schools and 438 Division III schools. Division III schools are smaller in size with a median enrollment of 1,740 students with 1 in 6 being a student-athlete. Division I schools have a median enrollment of 8,960 where 1 in 23 students are athletes. There are groups that govern each division individually as they are unique in their needs ("Our Three Divisions", 2020). </p>
            <h4>Youth and Social Media</h4>
                <p>Social media sites are ways for people to connect to one another virtually through online profiles, pictures, videos, and status updates. The early 2000s brought about many different platforms that served different purposes on the surface, but ultimately had the goal of connecting users to one another. As smart phones entered the hands of every teenager, the amount of screen-time increased. According to a survey by the non-profit Common Sense Media, 70% of teenagers ages 13-17 use social media once a day. Eighty-one percent of teenagers are on social media platforms; Snapchat is the most frequently used at 63% with Instagram not far behind at 61%. Facebook usage has decreased by 68% since 2013 to only 15% of teenagers using the platform (Harold, 2018). The Pew Research Center released a survey on social media usage among U.S. adults that shows 73% of 18 to 24-year-olds use Snapchat, 75% use Instagram, and 76% use Facebook (Perrin & Anderson, 2020). Those statistics reflect how prominent social media has become in our society, especially in the 13-24 age groups. The increased usage for young adults shows an increase in importance for that demographic to be on social networking sites. There are pros and cons to consuming social media at these levels. Benefits include being a part of a community, meeting new people, self-expression, and learning information about a variety of concepts. With these benefits, however, come downsides. Such downsides include sleep disruption, cyberbullying, and potential for depression and anxiety (Teens and social media use: What's the impact? 2019).</p>
            <h4>Social Media and the NCAA</h4>
                <p>The growth of social media also led to a growth of accessibility of sports clips, live streams, and more opportunities for the NCAA to advertise their events. Not only that, but social media now offers more opportunities for students, both high school and college, to make or break their careers as athletes. Some college athletic programs began enforcing policies that required athletes to stop using social media, ‘friend’ coaches and staff on social media, or even allow the school’s administration access to their accounts. There was backlash against the NCAA specifically for allowing such practices that even went as far as questioning the constitutionality of these requirements to play a sport (An Unconstitutional Playbook WHY THE NCAA MUST STOP MONITORING STUDENT-ATHLETES’PASSWORD-PROTECTED SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT, 2020).  I was unable to locate any information on the resolution of these issues, however, the NCAA website now features a social media literacy program for their student-athletes. According to the cite, ‘the program was designed to cultivate responsible social media attitudes and use’ ("Social Media Literacy for Student-Athletes", 2020).</p>
            <h4>Social Media and Recruitment</h4>
                <p>The NCAA now includes rules on communication between coaches and recruits via social media in their recruitment guidelines. Recruitment is defined as face-to-face contact, phone calls or texts, mail, emails, or social media interactions between a college employee and a high school student (Recruiting 2020).</p>
                <p>College coaches have begun scouring the web for potential recruits’ social media accounts to get a better look at who they are off the court/field/pitch. Social media conversations have become part of the guidance high school students receive who want to play college sports. When discussing the role social media presence plays in the recruitment process, Coach Hand at Penn State said there is a difference between normal teenage content and posts that raise red flags. “…degrading women, referencing drug use, and anything that has to do with cyberbullying…There’s certain things you don’t want to be part of your program,” said Hand (CBS News, 2014).</p>
                <p>Athletic recruitment advice websites have begun including tips for high school students on how to cultivate the ideal social media image for college coaches. According to Next College Student Athlete (NCSA), 85% of coaches research recruits online. 87% of those coaches used Facebook, 79% used Twitter, and 65% use Instagram. To best become acquainted with coaches, students are advised to have public accounts, highlight their accomplishments, and keep their content respectful ("How to use social media in your recruiting", 2020).</p>
                <p>The NCAA has taken constant criticism for their policies that seem self-servient and geared towards money. Colleges want to have high-performing athletic teams in order to generate extra revenue outside of tuition. Coaches have to consider their team’s image and how the players are seen in the media in order to appeal to new recruits, as well as sponsors. There is a lot to consider when you are a coach looking at a high school athlete beyond talent. With media deals, video games and other marketing materials possible for big name athletes, how the media perceives a team and player all circles back around to the money a team will make. All these things are taken into account when recruiting athletes, especially at the Division I level. Social media offers coaches a unique opportunity to get to know an athlete beyond the field before making them an offer. Perspective student-athletes, coaches, and collegiate athletic departments have begun to recognize the impact social media has on the recruitment process and it is my intention to further explore how each entity uses social media to accomplish their goals. </p>
