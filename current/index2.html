            <p>I have always been intrigued by college athletics being a non-athletic regular person on campus. I often ask student-athletes what brought them to Washington and Lee University, especially when they are from high schools across the country. This same curiosity was present when I was considering a topic for my independent research. I knew I wanted to combine sports and technology which landed me where I am today: exploring the effect of social media on college athletic recruitment. </p>
            <p>When I began my research, I soon realized the lack of depth in this category. Past research may touch on a few NCAA Division I schools and how they promote their sports, but little is available on the personal level. I wanted to bring in real people’s stories and experiences to analyze potential trends in using social media as a recruiting tool. </p>
            <p>What I found was a lack of general consideration for social media in the NCAA Division III recruiting process at Washington and Lee. Both players and coaches looked beyond what was available on social media platforms and made decisions based on character and opportunities. Despite the educational tools available on the NCAA’s website regarding social media etiquette, coaches said they never felt the need to have a formal conversation with their teams due to the general awareness players possess now adays. Social media has been a prominent part of the players upbringing that many have learned the “do’s and don’t’s” of posting and how posts can reflect onto things bigger than the individual.</p>
            <p>I was impressed by the variety of experiences each player had when being recruited by Washington and Lee. No story was the same, but all are happy with their decisions. Ultimately, this research provided an inside look into the world of Washington and Lee athletics and the student experience. Moving forward, I am interested in expanding upon this research and hopefully gathering quantitative data in order to further analyze the role of social media. </p>
