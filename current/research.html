            <h2>Research Methods and Analysis</h2>
            <h3>I conducted interviews with members of the athletic community at Washington and Lee University. You will find my summaries and analysis below.</h3>
        </section>
        <section id = 'research_body'>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>In an effort to better understand the relationship between collegiate sports and social media, I conducted a series of interviews with coaches and athletes at Washington and Lee University. The goal of these interviews was to find commonalities between sports and how the coaching staff utilizes social media during the recruitment process. I also spoke with players to learn about their recruitment experience and how much of a role social media played in their decisions. </p>
                <p>Washington and Lee is an NCAA Division III school in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. I recognize that the interviews provide insight into one school’s athletic environment. In the future I would like to expand upon these interviews by talking to coaches and players at institutions representative of all NCAA divisions and conferences. </p>
            <h4>Methodology</h4>
                <p>For these interviews I spoke with Coach Ted White (baseball), Coach Neil Cunningham (women’s soccer), Coach Bryan Snyder (volleyball), and Coach Jimmie Mack Johnson III (football). I also interviewed Peyton McCann (baseball), Annie Martin (women’s soccer), and Luke Haws (football). I had prepared sets of questions that were the same for each coach and player. The questions addressed the use of social media in the recruitment process, as well as the use of social media in curating a team image online. Each interview was recorded with permission of the interviewee for future reference. Below is an overview analysis of these interviews followed by analysis broken up by sport.</p>    
            <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Across all four sports the coaches listed academics as the number one consideration when recruiting players. The high academic rigor required of Washington and Lee students is not ignored when building an incoming class of athletes. Following academic ability, coaches begin to consider what skills of value the player would bring to the team, as well as whether or not their character is cohesive with the team dynamic. These later considerations are assessed through direct communication with the prospective student either over the phone, on Zoom, or in person prior to the pandemic. All four coaches also admitted to doing a lack of social media research on the prospective athlete due to a respect for their private lives. Three of the four coaches felt it was not their place to look at a high schooler’s social media and instead relied on the current team members to report any suspicious or unbecoming posts they saw from recruits. Typical posts the coaches could expect from the recruits include general high school pictures of them with friends, and maybe even one or two at a party, but they did not see those as red flags. All four coaches also admitted to not having any formal conversations about social media usage with their teams upon their arrival.</p>
                <p>The lack of social media consideration was surprising to learn as the prevalence of social media has increased in recent years. Based on the NCAA’s updated rules regarding social media communication between recruits and coaches, one would assume social media to play a larger role in the consideration of a player at Washington and Lee. The common theme, however, amongst the Washington and Lee coaches was that they recruit upstanding students of good character and merit, so they did not feel they had to worry about inappropriate social media use. </p>
            <h4>Baseball</h4>
                <p>Coach Ted White has been the head coach of Washington and Lee’s baseball team for four years. His approach to social media when it comes to recruitment is very minimal. As someone who is not an avid social media user, he does not feel it necessary to look into a recruit’s social media. Instead, after recruits come to visit campus, the current team members follow the recruit’s social media accounts. If a current player finds something off-putting, Coach White will call up the recruit and ask him about it as a way to offer an opportunity to explain the post and take responsibility for the mistake. Coach White did not say there has ever been an instance of anything so egregious that has lost a recruit their spot on the team.</p>
                <p>When it comes to actively recruiting players, Coach White said he does not turn to social media. Instead, he relies on connections within the baseball community and seeing potential recruits play in tournaments. Peyton McCann ’21 said he had a more unusual recruitment experience with Washington and Lee. Coach White never saw Peyton play in person, instead the coach prior to Coach White saw a video of him pitching at a tournament and decided to pursue him as a recruit. Peyton said his interest in Washington and Lee’s program grew from his research of the school itself. When he visited the school and met the current players, he was able to get more of an idea about what it was like being a Washington and Lee baseball player. When it came to social media’s impact on Peyton’s decision to come to Washington and Lee, he said it was the men he met here and what they posted that convinced him to come, not what the school or baseball team itself posted. </p>
                <p>As far as the baseball team’s social media presence, Coach White said the primary audience includes the parents, alumni, and current players. They do not use their social media as a recruitment tool because they do not have the coaching staff to dedicate to social media. They post periodically to keep parents and alumni engaged, and to make current players smile, but not much else past that. The team is too focused on performing well during practice and games to worry about capturing an engaging picture or interview to post. </p>
                <p>Overall, Coach White and Washington and Lee’s baseball team does not put emphasis on social media during or after the recruitment process. Instead, the coaches and players focus more on the person themselves and if they are the right fit for the team. </p>
            <h4>Soccer</h4>
                <p>Coach Neil Cunningham has been the head coach of the Washington and Lee women’s soccer team for twenty years and has a similar approach to social media as Coach Ted White. Coach Cunningham claims it is none of his business what girls are posting on their social media, as long as it is nothing racist, sexist, hateful, or something that would be an embarrassment to the program. The emphasis during the recruitment process is placed on who the young woman is and how well she contributes to team culture.</p>
                <p>For Coach Cunningham, the recruitment process begins at the Washington and Lee annual soccer summer camp. He prefers seeing players in person so he can truly get a feeling for how they play and who they are on the field. In normal years, Coach Cunningham will travel to tournaments across the country to see prospective players play because he values the in-person evaluation so highly. </p>
                <p>Annie Martin ’23 said she did not consider NCAA division III soccer until her dad mentioned Washington and Lee’s high academic standards in addition to a solid soccer program. Her initial contact to Coach Cunningham was via email and that is how they fostered a recruitment relationship. When asked about experience with social media and recruitment, Annie said she did reach out to the Harvard University women’s soccer coach via Twitter direct message but never received a reply. Aside from that experience, the social media of a college did not affect her decision to pursue them. </p>
                <p>Like the baseball social media, the soccer team does not place much emphasis on sharing to their platform as a way to attract recruits. Coach Cunningham says he liked to highlight the players and show pictures of the team, but that it is primarily for the parents, alumni, and current players. As far as individual social media accounts, Coach Cunningham does not feel the need to monitor what is posted by players or perspective players. Annie says she remembers coaches mentioning to be smart on social media, but no one has ever given a formal list of do’s and don’ts. All players are told to be mindful of how they represent their team even off the field. </p>
            <h4>Volleyball</h4> 
                <p>Coach Bryan Snyder is entering his 21st year as head coach of Washington and Lee volleyball. His social media practices are the same as Coach White and Coach Cunningham’s – very minimal consideration when looking at a potential recruit. Instead, Coach Snyder looks more at the hard skills a player possesses and if they would be coachable. This is a different approach than the previous two coaches in that they emphasized character over skill.</p>    
                <p>Despite the lack of social media consideration when looking at a recruit, technology has come to play a large role in Coach Snyder’s recruitment process, thanks to the pandemic. The volleyball program would host weekly Zoom panels during quarantine to allow prospective players to come and ask the coaches and players questions. Participation in this would be a way for the coaches to see who is interested and committed to learning more about Washington and Lee, as well as a way for prospective players to learn more about the program and if it was the right fit for them.</p>
                <p>The annual volleyball camp held by Washington and Lee was put on hold this year, along with all other sport camps. Prospective players adapted to the situation by filming themselves performing drills and showcasing their skills to send into the coaches. The level of commitment those prospective players showed was noted by Coach Snyder and made recruits stand out for their creative solutions. </p>
                <p>The volleyball team’s social media use was one that was geared more towards to perspective players. They wanted to showcase current players in a way that would help perspectives find someone with commonalities that would allow them to be a good resource for the perspective students. This also helped to build relationships prior to a recruit coming to campus which would bolster a collaborative team dynamic.</p>
                <p>Coach Snyder also talked about the growing prevalence in recruitment-specific social media profiles for perspective players. He said that high school students who want to play in college would frequently have a separate social media account that would solely be used as a way to promote themselves as a player and gain interest from coaches. The popularity of such accounts has grown in the recent years as more students are actively separating their personal lives from their recruiting experience. </p>
                <p>I find it interesting how there is more of an emphasis placed on social media image for volleyball than for the other two sports discussed thus far. Although Coach Snyder does not look at or consider an individual’s personal social media account, there does appear to be more of a focus on technology and how much of an image they can curate as both a volleyball program and as a perspective recruit. </p>
            <h4>Football</h4>
                <p>Coach Jimmie Mack Johnson III is entering his first year as a coach for the Washington and Lee football team after just graduating from the program himself in 2020. Coach Johnson offered a very different perspective to social media as a football coach than any of the other sports. This is not a surprise as it is well-known within the athletic community that football relies heavily on social media platforms, such as Twitter.</p>
                <p>Coach Johnson said he often browses Twitter as a way to find students to reach out to. He will look at who is following the Washington and Lee football Twitter to see who has shown interest in that regard as a starting point. He said he also will go to competitor schools’ Twitter accounts to see who they have expressed interest in to see if it would be worth his time to also reach out to that perspective player. High school football players will often have their statistics, position, and GPA in their Twitter bio which makes it easy for Coach Johnson so make a quick decision on whether or not to message them. They will also frequently have links to their highlight tapes easily accessible to coaches in their Twitter bio.</p>
                <p>If Coach Johnson likes what he sees at first glance, he will initiate communication with the perspective student by direct messaging him and asking to see their transcripts. Coach Johnson, like the other three coaches, emphasized the importance of a recruit having the academic background necessary to succeed at Washington and Lee before they are considered for a sports program. Also similar to the other coaches, Coach Johnson does not intentionally look for red flags in the perspective player’s social media. If he comes across something, however, he will ensure it is nothing racist, sexist, or hateful. There are specific Twitter rules that Coach Johnson has to keep in mind when communicating with a perspective recruit. He said that they cannot comment on a recruit’s post but are allowed to like them. </p>
                <p>The Washington and Lee football social media accounts are highly active in an attempt to entice perspective players. They try to highlight the team culture as a way to show how their program would be superior to other programs. There is an intern who is a current student who’s job is to make graphics, videos, and posts to share on social media. The current players, parents, and alumni also enjoy these posts as a way to still feel engaged. </p>
                <p>Luke Haws ’23 received some of these graphics as a perspective recruit which enticed him to pursue Washington and Lee football. He said he received a postcard with a Washington and Lee uniform photoshopped onto his body as a way for him to ‘picture’ himself playing for Washington and Lee. Luke also talked about his recruitment process and using the social media accounts of other schools as a way to gage how well he would like the program. Washington and Lee stood out to him due to the high academic standards and opportunity to be a part of the football family. </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Social media is constantly growing and changing as users find new ways to utilize the networking properties and opportunities. College coaches all have differing approaches to how they use social media in their recruitment processes. Some coaches opt out of prying into the personal lives of recruits and do not look at their social media. These coaches appear to instead rely on in-person interactions and character references from current players to gage how well a recruit would fit into the program. The coaches that do look more at social media still consider the character of the person and what they are sharing on social media.  Team social media accounts appear to share a purpose of keeping parents and alumni engaged while also enticing perspective students to look into the program. High school students looking to play college sports have learned to curate a social media presence that attracts coaches to them. After speaking to the coaches and players, however, I believe coaches still rely on the in-person interactions with players, instead of social media, when making decisions. Even as social media usage increases, it appears that there is no replacing the value of real human interaction.  </p>
            <h3>Additional Research</h3>
            <p>This coming semester I intend to continue this research by creating a way to survey a representative sample of athletes at Washington and Lee to obtain quatitative data. This will allow me to further analyze the role of social media on athlete recruitment and the simmilarities between sports.</p>
