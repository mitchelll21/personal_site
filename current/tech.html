       <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
       <p>To gather the data for this analysis, I created a survey to capture participantsâ€™ experience with social media before, during, and after the recruitment process. One survey was made to be sent to student athletes and one was made for the coaches. The surveys were made using Google Forms to allow ease of distribution and transfer of data into a useable format. Ninety-six student athletes responded to the athlete survey while eight coaches responded to their survey.</p> 
        <p>The responses were exported into excel then moved to R Studio Cloud. Primary analysis was conducted using R Studio Cloud. The data was transformed minimally and put into tidy formatting to better fit some visualizations. To better visualize specific variables, the data would be filtered using certain criteria. All responses were used in the main analysis with the exception of one response being left out of the gender analysis due to conflicting responses with gender and sport selected. The visualizations were created with the ggplot and plotly packages.</p> 
        <p>The surveys were approved by the Washington and Lee University Institutional Review Board. Due to the nature of the data and the potential identities being associated with responses, the survey results will not be made public. </p>
        <p>I would like to acknowledge the faculty of the Digital Culture and Information Department at Washington and Lee University for their help and guidance during this year long research project. I specifically want to thank Dr. Mickel and Professor Brooks for their support and assistance in carrying out this project- including the structuring of this website. Finally, I would also like to thank the coaches and student athletes at Washington and Lee who were willing to be interviewed and take part in this survey. The project would not have happened without their cooperation.</p>
