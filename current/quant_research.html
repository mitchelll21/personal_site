            <H2>Research Methods and Analysis Pt. 2</H2>
            <H3>Following the interviews, I decided to survey the athletic community at Washington and Lee University to see if the numbers supported the calims in the interviews.</H3>
                <p>My research during the fall provided great insight into the individual experiences of a few coaches and athletes at Washington and Lee University. The interviews, however, did leave me with a few questions. Did students and coaches have the same perception of how to use social media during recruitment? Is there a social media platform that is used more often than others for recruitment? Does gender of the athlete and/or coach affect the prevalence of social media usage during the recruitment process?</p>
                <p>To help answer these questions and more, I surveyed current Washington and Lee University athletes and coaches on their experience using social media during the athletic recruitment process.</p>
                <p>The online surveys consisted of 10-14 questions about platform preference, how social media affects the perception of the school/recruit, and recollection of experiences with social media during recruitment. The surveys were approved by Washington and Lee University’s Institutional Review Board and dispersed to the athletes and coaches via email. 95 student athletes and 8 coaches responded to the surveys. That is about 21% of student athletes and 38% of head coaches at Washington and Lee. A breakdown of the respondents can be found below with the analysis here.</p>

            <H3>Athletes</H3>
                <p>The athletes that responded to the survey represent 16 of the 24 varsity sports teams. The gender distribution was 35 females, or 37% of respondents, and 60 males equating to 63% of respondents. All four class years currently at Washington and Lee were represented in this sample as well.</p>

            <H3>Perceptions of Social Media Use</H3>
            <H3>Coaches</H3>
                <p>Through the prior interviews, I found that overall social media was given a lack of consideration by coaches and athletes (with football being the exception). I found this to be especially surprising given the frequency of social media usage among the young adult/college aged demographic. In the survey, I asked questions to further dive into how coaches recruit, as well as further exploring the aversions to social media in recruiting.</p>
                <p>When initiating contact with a recruit, 88% of the coaches surveyed used email with only one using social media. 38% of the coaches said they begin looking at a recruits’ social media after making initial contact, while others had a different approach.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The platforms coaches use to look into social media are shown below.</p>
                <p>GRAPH</p>
                <p>I was  curious as to how much a coach weighs a recruits social media presence when making a decision about whether or not to extend an offer. I asked the coaches to rank on a scale of 1-10 how likely they were to make a decision on a recruit based on what they saw on social media. Lower values indicate less of a likelihood and higher values indicate being more likely to consider social media. </p>
                <figure class='pictures' id='likelihood'>
                    <img src='../images/likelihood.png' alt='histogram showing coaches likelihood of considering a recruits social media' title='Likelihood ranking of considering sns' id='likelihood'>
                    <figcaption id=likelihood1>The coaches were asked to rank the likelihood of them considering a recruit's social media when extending an offer. Most coaches indicated a very low likelihood of considering social media whereas one coach would highly consider the social media of a recruit.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I expected to see most coaches choose a value less than five given the previous answers  indicate a lack of social media consideration. I was surprised to see two coaches chose a five on the scale. I was not surprised by eight indicated on the scale by one coach due to previous questions indicating one of the coaches surveyed puts a larger emphasis on social media than others.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on the interviews from last semester when one coach stated it was none of his business what young women were posting on their social media, I was interested to see if there was a difference in social media consideration based on the gender of the coach and gender of the athletes. I found there to be, however, no such differences based on gender.</p>

                    <figcaption id=genderlikelihood2>This graph separates the likelihood ranking by gender of the sport the coach coaches while also highlighting the gender of the coach.

            <H3>Athletes</H3>
                <p>After learning about the ways different coaches use social media in recruiting, I began to wonder if student athletes felt the lack of social media consideration from coaches while going through the recruitment process. To address this, I asked the student athletes about their experiences using social media while being recruited to see if the lack of consideration was universal in the athletic world.</p> 
                <p>Of the athletes who responded, 55.3% said they had conversations regarding social media etiquette and how it pertained to recruitment. These conversations were primarily with their parents and coaches that were not associated with a school.</p> 
                <p>GRAPH</p> 
                <p>Following  these conversations, 20% of those athletes altered their social media profiles to appeal to coaches. These changes were primarily ridding their profiles of any allusions to alcohol or illegal behavior. The changes cited by athletes align exactly with how to avoid the ‘red flags’ coaches listed as being reasons to avoid a recruit. For some athletes, they created profiles for recruitment purposes, further enforcing the idea that social media is more important in recruitment than the interviews portrayed.</p>   
                <p>Not only do recruits feel their social media profiles matter, but the profiles of colleges’ athletic programs are important in shaping recruits’ perceptions of their programs. Of athletes surveyed, 76% used social media to look into college programs. The most popular platform used was Instagram, followed by Twitter.</p>
                <p>GRAPH</p>  
                <p>For the athletes who looked at schools’ social media accounts, 48% said the content of the accounts changed their perception of the program. That change was positive or neutral for 97% of those athletes and negative for only 3% of the athletes. This demonstrates the impact of a well-kept social media presence by athletic programs. There is potential to attract more recruits while creating a positive image for the program with an active account.</p>  
                <p>I wanted to see if coaches knew of the recruiting potential held in social media profiles so I inquired about the existence of team accounts. Every coach said they have a social media account for the team - Instagram is used by every coach, followed by Twitter and Facebook profiles used by 75% of coaches, and one coach using a team blog. The content of the posts vary with the main content being team news, posts about practices or games, and promotional materials to attract recruits.</p>    
                <p>Overall, it appears that social media usage during recruitment is very prevalent for athletes leading them to be more aware of their social media presence during the process. Given the age range of most college athletes, it is not surprising they utilize social media in any way they can due to the frequency of use seen in this age group. The coaches at Washington and Lee University do not appear to use social media as a primary recruitment tool, aside from the football program. Instead, it seems social media is a subsidiary to the more traditional ways of recruitment, such as emails and in-person contact. The fact that most Washington and Lee coaches look into the social media of recruits shows they are aware of the prevalence among this age group and the potential for it to display their character. The lack of consideration, however, also shows they know there is more to the story than an Instagram post and look beyond what is on the web.</p>
            <H3>Implications and Next Steps</H3>
                <p>The data collected in these surveys in conjunction with the interviews conducted last semester offer insight into the priorities of Washington and Lee coaches during recruitment, as well as the athletes who were recruited. The survey data continues to support the conclusion of the interviews that most coaches prefer recruiting through networking, in person visits, and continued conversation as compared to basing decisions on social media profiles. While this seems to work well currently, the fact that student athletes are more aware of the potential in social media recruiting tools suggests these tools are being talked about and used already in the sports world. As technology and innovation continue to expand, coaches should also be learning how to utilize the new tools before they are left behind and out-recruited by competitor schools.</p>
                <p>The next step of this project would be to survey colleges and universities that are similar to Washington and Lee to compare recruitment tactics and identify any commonalities or differences. While good in theory, I am not confident that other athletic programs would be willing to talk about their recruitment processes. Instead, I think interviewing more athletes about their specific experiences while being recruited could offer insight into how other schools on varying levels recruit student athletes. Knowing where Washington and Lee University stands in comparison to other institutions will allow the coaches to remain competitive and recruit the best athletes.</p>
