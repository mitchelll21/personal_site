                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Although I am young, I have had a broad range of experiences that have lead me to where I am today. I have worked hard to overcome many challenges thrown my way. Ultimately, every experience has shaped me into a hard-working, detail oriented student with a never ending drive to learn more. I have tried my best to icorporate my passions for music, sports, and people into what I do. I strive to find new connections as a way to bring people together. My hope is that my work can bring people together through commonalities and show that we are all one in the same.</p>

                <h2>Professional Insights</h2>
                <p>My love of making connections has lead me to a world of data analysis, as well as cognitive and behavioral science. I turned to three professionals in the world of sports and data analysis to garner advice on what would make me stand out to employers. All three harped on the importance of a genuine desire and interest in my work, no matter what lens I am looking through. Relevant experiences, as well as the ability to effectively communicate those experiences, will set me apart. I have designed this website to highlight some of my favorite projects that have also helped shape my academic career and professional interests. I have tried to keep everything concise and clear to maintain simplicity.</p>
