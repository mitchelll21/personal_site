            <h2 id='comm'>Communications Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked in communications since I was a junior in high school interning at a local radio station. My love for broadcasting and media grew from there. I now hold multiple positions at Washington and Lee's radio station, 91.5fm WLUR, where I do anything from sorting music, to broadcasting sporting events, plannning student concerts, and running our social media accounts. I am also the Communications Chair for Washington and Lee's First Year Orientation Committee. In this role I lead a team of social media platform leaders as we generate content for incoming first-year students. I also work closely with Washington and Lee deans, as well as student affairs and other campus organizations. While at Washington and Lee, I have taken many communications courses, including digital journalism, which have taught me how to communicate effectively and utilize technology.</p>
            <p>Outside of Washington and Lee, I have experience working in sports communications. I have worked in the press box for a minor league baseball team doing anything from operating cameras to creating play-by-plays for our live broadcasts. I learned a whole different side to communcations while working in that position. I also was a marketing and communications intern for Virginia Amateur Sports for the Commonwealth Games during summer 2020. This position involved a lot of social media content creation and fan engagement. All around, I have been exposed to several aspects of communications through my work in school and outside of school.</p>

            <h2 id='ds'>Data Science</h2>
            <p>I have recently become interested in the world of data science. I have worked on several research projects on campus that have required data analysis and visualizations. These projects have been in psychology, politcs, and DCI courses, allowing for experience in both quantitative and qualitative research and analysis. I have learned programs, such as R, Python, and SPSS, which I can utilize when performing analysis. I look forward to exploring more of the data science world in the coming years.</p>

            <h2 id='sports'>Sports</h2>
            <p>Sports have been a part of my life since before I could walk. My family has always gone to baseball and soccer games with many of us playing both sports. I started working for the minor league baseball team in Salem, Virginia right after high school. For two summers I worked in promotions, then I changed things up and worked in the production booth my third summer. At Washington and Lee I have been a color-commentator and play-by-play announcer for the men and women's soccer teams, as well as the baseball team. When I am now commentating, I am often producing broadcasts for other W&L sporting events.</p>
